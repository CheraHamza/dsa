# dsa

My solution to some assignements under the data structures and algorithmes section of the Javascript course that is part of The Odin Project. (section name: "A bit of computer science")

# what I have learned:

- solid base on recursion and devide & conquer approach.
- The importance of time complexity and space complexity in algorithms.
- how to implement some common sorting and searching algorithms
- what defines a data structure and how to implement some common ADTs (abstract data types) like stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.
